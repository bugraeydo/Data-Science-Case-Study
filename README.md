# Data-Science-Case-Study

This repository contains the solution for the predictive modeling tasks in the energy performance prediction and bank telemarketing prediction domains.

## Energy Performance Prediction

The task in this problem was to build predictive models for estimating the energy performance of residential buildings. The dataset used was ENB2012_data.xlsx, comprising 768 samples and 8 features. Ridge Regression was employed to predict the heating and cooling loads of the buildings. Cross-validation was performed to evaluate the models' performance.

## Bank Telemarketing Prediction

In this problem, the goal was to develop predictive models for predicting the success of bank telemarketing campaigns. The dataset used was bankadditional-full.csv, containing information about bank client data, contact communication, previous campaign outcomes, and more. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network models were built to predict the campaign success.

## Tasks Completed

The homework involved the following tasks:

1. Energy Performance Prediction:
   - Built predictive models using Ridge Regression
   - Evaluated the models using cross-validation

2. Bank Telemarketing Prediction:
   - Developed predictive models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network
   - Performed model evaluation and optimization

Please refer to the code provided in this repository for the detailed implementation and solution.
